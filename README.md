# TISimulator
Combat Simulator for Twilight Imperium 4th Edition

## GOAL
Create combat metrics for cost efficiency of each unit via monte-carlo simulation.

## Questions:
1. Baseline composition setups w/ same Cost
	
 1a. 3-5

 1b. 6-10

 1c. 11-15

 1d. 16-20

2. Most cost efficient ships?
3. Which Compositions punch above their weight class
4. Best upgrades?


## Conclusions:
1. Higher fleet capacity are more efficient. Massing Destroyers is really good, but capacity inefficient.
2. Fighters are bad until 12/13 cost, 5/6 capacity respectively


## Problems:
Destroyers are over-emphasized since fighters make up so much of the low-ranks.
Split field in half and rerun calculations.
